\section{Introduction}

There are a wide variety of resources available to people to keep track of
events and activities, remind them about these, and to make them more
productive. Two approaches are commonly used: 1. using physical reminders such
as post-it notes and diaries. The drawback here is that the user is physically
constrained. For example if the user has post-it notes at home, these notes
aren't accessible when she is in the library; and 2. using software reminders,
such as Google Keep and Google Calendar. Although they are available to use for
free, these are easy to ignore as they only exist virtually (only provide
simple notifications) and are not reflected sufficiently enough in the physical
world.

This project attempts a new approach to this application. What if it were
possible for a physical object in a user's space that could draw attention and
spark user reaction in a more effective manner? What if there could be an
object that can play the role of a friend that reminds a person about the
occurrence of an event? Wouldn't it be great if someone were to tell you to
stop what you were doing and keep up with your new year resolution of running
5K everyday? Graphical User Interfaces, by their nature, do not create an
emotional bond with a user in most interfaces. Having an emotional bond with an
object can greatly enhance user experience with that particular object,
irrespective of the simplicity of its purpose.


Ritchie the DeskBuddy is just the device for the role. Ritchie is a 3D printed
robotic tiger that sits on a user's desk and reminds them of events or
activities that need to be done. As an internet-connected device, Ritchie can
be of great utility when provided with pertinent data sources. To be clear,
Ritchie is not an AI robot. It cannot tell you what you need to do, or tell you
about the weather. Nor can it specifically remind you to buy some eggs on your
way back home. What Ritchie can do is wave its arms and move around to get your
attention about something important. The rest is upto the user to check on the
topic of concern. The events can range anything from small everyday events to
more important things that demand immediate action.

\section{Related Work}

Peek et.\ al \cite{peek2009hangsters} describe Hangster, an ambient display that
embodies virtual interactions using physical devices hanging on strings. These
devices are designed to look like personalized avatars. Hangster allows a
person to see their friend's status (online/offline) on a messaging application
(by lowering/raising the avatar), and allow some simple interactions - e.g.\
initiate a conversation by gently tugging on the avatar string, show
notifications by moving. Dino\footnote{Dino - Ambient Display Creature:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AvST9wjrkC4} is an ambient display that
controls a physical object to react to the nature of conversations on a chat
application. By studying the content of the conversation, the ``egg'' moves to
show whether it is happy, sad, angry or calm. Similarly,
Availabot\footnote{Availabot: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w0voYnEjFcQ} is a
computer-controlled push puppet that stands or falls down to reflect a friend's
availability (online/offline status) on a chat application.

%      dimensions and do not flow the margin text to the
%      next page. \\
%      \vspace{1pc} \textbf{Materials:} The margin box must not intrude
%      or overflow into the header or the footer, or the gutter space
%      between the margin paragraph and the main left column. The text
%      in this text box should remain the same size as the body
%      text. Use the \texttt{{\textbackslash}vspace{}} command to set
%      the margin
%      note's position. \\
%      \vspace{1pc} \textbf{Images \& Figures:} Practically anything
%      can be put in the margin if it fits. Use the
%      \texttt{{\textbackslash}marginparwidth} constant to set the
%      width of the figure, table, minipage, or whatever you are trying
%      to fit in this skinny space.
